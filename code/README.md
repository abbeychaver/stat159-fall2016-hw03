The scripts in this folder do supporting analysis for report.Rmd and report.pdf.

eda-script.R plots histograms, some summary data output to eda-output.txt, and correlation data to correlation_matrix.Rdata.

Regression-script.R provides scatterplots and a linear regression object saved to the workspace.

In order to run them, please cd to the root directory and run "make".
